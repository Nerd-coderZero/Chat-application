# Project Title: **AI Chatbot for Healthcare**

## Description
This project involves building an AI-powered chatbot that can answer healthcare-related questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The chatbot utilizes a deep learning model trained on medical data to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries in the healthcare domain.

## Features
- **Healthcare FAQs**: The chatbot can provide answers to frequently asked questions about healthcare topics.
- **Real-time interaction**: The chatbot provides real-time interaction for medical queries and can assist users with general healthcare information.
- **Model-based Responses**: Uses an NLP-based model trained on healthcare-related text for accurate information.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Virtual Environment (recommended)
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nerd-coderZero/Chat-application/tree/master.git
    cd your_repo
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (Optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    If you have a `requirements.txt` file in the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    If your project is a script or web app (e.g., Flask), you can run the following:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or similar) in your local browser.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot via a simple web interface (if it's a web app) or through the terminal (if it's a command-line-based chatbot).

- **Web Application**: Open your browser and go to the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the chatbot.
- **Terminal Application**: Follow the prompts in your terminal to enter queries for the chatbot.
